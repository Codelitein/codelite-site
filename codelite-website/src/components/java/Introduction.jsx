            <h2>Introduction to Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language that minimizes implementation dependencies. It allows developers to <strong>write once, run anywhere (WORA)</strong>, meaning compiled Java code is executable on any platform that supports Java, without requiring recompilation. Initially released in 1995, Java is widely utilized for creating applications for desktops, web, and mobile devices. Its simplicity, robustness, and security make it a favored choice for enterprise-level applications.</p>

        <section id="history">
            <h2>History of Java</h2>
            <p>Java’s development began in 1991 with James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems. Originally named "Oak," it was later renamed "Java," inspired by Java coffee. Java 1.0 was publicly released in 1996, offering a no-cost runtime environment across popular platforms. Despite not being formalized through ISO standards, Sun Microsystems provided most Java implementations for free, earning revenue by licensing specialized products. A significant milestone occurred in 2006 when Sun Microsystems released a large portion of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as open-source software.</p>

            <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java's compiler converts source code to bytecode, which can run on any platform with a JVM, making it platform-independent.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong> Java promotes object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Java’s syntax is easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C or C++, and it eliminates complex features like pointers.</li>
                <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> Java is designed to be reliable, with features like garbage collection, exception handling, and memory allocation.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Java’s lack of pointers and its secure execution environment make it a safe choice for developing applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Java enables the creation of distributed applications using Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).</li>
                <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Java supports concurrent execution of multiple threads, enhancing performance for complex applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Java’s platform-independent bytecode allows programs to run on different machines without modification.</li>
                <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Java’s architecture minimizes runtime overhead, and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation improves execution speed.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="execution">
            <h2>How Java Code Executes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Creating the Program:</strong> Java programs are written using a text editor or an IDE and saved with a .java extension.</li>
                <li><strong>Compiling the Program:</strong> The Java compiler (javac) converts the source code into bytecode, stored in a .class file.</li>
                <li><strong>Running the Program:</strong> The JVM executes the bytecode, translating it into machine code specific to the operating system.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Example Program:</p>
            <pre><code>
public class HelloWorld &#123;
    public static void main(String[] args) &#123;
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    &#125;
&#125;
            </code></pre>

            <h2>Advantages of Java</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Platform Independent:</strong> Java code can run on any platform with a JVM, enabling cross-platform compatibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java supports object-oriented principles, making it a flexible and organized language.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Java’s built-in security features ensure safe application development.</li>
                <li><strong>Large Community:</strong> Java’s extensive developer community provides ample resources and support.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise-Level Applications:</strong> Java is widely used for developing robust, scalable enterprise-level applications.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="disadvantages">
            <h2>Disadvantages of Java</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Java can be slower than other languages like C++ due to its use of a virtual machine and automatic memory management.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Java’s automatic memory management may lead to increased memory usage, impacting performance.</li>
            </ul>
